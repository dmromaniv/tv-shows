# TV-show
This is a React-based web application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows on a server and view detailed information about them.

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Axios (library for making HTTP requests)
- Animate (library for animations)
- Vercel (deployment platform)

## Functionality
The main functionality of this application is the ability to search for movies and TV shows based on a user's input. Users can enter a search term into the search bar, and the application will query the server for matching results.

When a user clicks on a movie or TV show from the search results, they are taken to a page with detailed information about that particular title. This information includes the title's poster, synopsis, rating, and other relevant details.

In the future, we plan to add the ability for users to save movies and TV shows to their favorites list.
